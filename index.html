        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Welcome to my Digital Rain project. This project is a modern C++ console application that simulates digital rain, inspired by the classic "Matrix" effect. The goal is to explore object-oriented design, modular code, and algorithmic creativity using modern C++ techniques.</p>
